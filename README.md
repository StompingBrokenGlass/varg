##Installation
###Using Composer (recommended)
The recommended way to get a working copy of this project is to clone the repository

Alternately, clone the repository and manually invoke `composer` using the shipped
`composer.phar`:
```bash
cd my/project/dir
git clone git://github.com/kwamaking/varg.git
cd varg
php composer.phar self-update
php composer.phar install

#Virtual Host
Afterwards, set up a virtual host to point to the public/ directory of the
project and you should be ready to go!
